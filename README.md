2. Enter the target IP address when prompted.
3. The program will scan ports and display the results.
4. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to exit the program, or use Ctrl + C at any time.

## Dependencies

## Notes

- The program uses Ctrl + C as a signal to exit gracefully.
- Scans ports in the range 1 to 1024.
